# The Impact of Past Behavior Normality on Regret:

## A Replication Study∗Reproduction of ’The relationship between the three elements: new experiences,luck, and compensation.

This repo contains the code and data to produce 1) a paper which is a reproduction of [Lucas Kutscheraand and Gilad Feldman's paper, "The impact of past behaviour normality on regret: replication andextension of three experiments of the exceptionality effect"](https://www.socialsciencereproduction.org/reproductions/bee4097e-9c14-4c32-baef-cf9f3fa61a2b/index) and 2) replications of the figures 1, 2, 3a, 3b of this paper figure1, 2, 3. 

It is organised as follows:

inputs
- data - contains all the data files to be used for analysis and in the tables and figures.
  - Ex1.csv - table for figure 1 
  - osf_past_normality_regret_replication_exp2_data_v2 - data for figures 2 and 3
  - Ex1.csv. - table for part1
  - osf-past-normality-regret-replication-exp1-data.csv - original table for experiment1
  - table2.csv - table for part2
  - osf-past-normality-regret-replication-exp1-data.R  - the original R code for part 1
  - osf-past-normality-regret-replication-exp2-data.R  - the original R code for part 2 and 3
- literature
  - Kutscher & Feldman 2019 CogEmo past behavior & regret-exceptionality replication & extension-w-supplement.pdf - the original paper of which we make a reproduction.

outputs
- paper
  - paper_2.pdf - the final paper
  - paper.qmd - Quarto file for the final paper
